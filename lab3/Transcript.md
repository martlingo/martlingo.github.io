(00:01) welcome back to the channel in this video we're going to try and complete the challenge to make €50 in an hour or less I've just dropped a video on how I think we can do this I dropped it yesterday if you haven't seen that you might want to go and check it out but I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and we're going to try it out ourselves now I think that this is that good I put my name to it we've called it the Matchmaker now I don't think anybody has ever done it before I've never seen
(00:30) a video on it I'll talk you through it and we'll play it together so after the ball lands well actually I'll talk you through it and then when the next ball Dan will do it so the way this works is very similar to the labu share but we are going to play two of the three dozens okay let me just go back to that list the labu share we we write out our Target profit which is 10 euros we're gonna do this five times basically the reason why we're doing 10 is to keep the bets not crazy because if you watch the
(01:06) video after a couple of losses it can get pretty big so I'm protecting ourselves and we've got 10 um singles here so we add the first and last number together and then this is the amount that we bet on our dozens and we're going to pick two dozens if we just go on our numbers we've got 11 and 27 so let me just do that so we got 11 and 27 I'm going to play Follow The Winner okay go back to that list first and last number added together two that's the amount that we're putting on both dozens so a total
(01:49) bet of four EOS we started at 728 we're going to try and make € 778 we just w we knock that off we knock that off and we can repeat the bet because we're playing the the last two um the last two dozens there they are 27 11 what we're going to do we're going to try and complete this list five times in less than an hour we are currently at well timer basically starts now you'll be able to tell I guess if we completed it early or maybe we lost our entire bank roll based on how long this video
(02:46) is I don't know because I've just started right there's a loss so we add allos now we have to bet five euros the numbers I'm following the winner so I'm going middle and last and when I say 5os 5os on both dozen go back to that list one plus four is obviously five that's the amount that we bet on each dozen let's see how this goes not a low number just like that to a bad start so we just lost 10 now we need to bet 11 and we're going 11 on the first and middle
(03:50) dozen go back to our list we lost two in a row already not a great start but I guess that'll just test how good this is how good this strategy is because we've got what a 66 just just under a 66% chance of of winning we should be winning more bets than we lose oh I just lost $22 but $22 bet $23 now just got there on the first dozen and the last dozen and our list is not looking good cuz I started with a bit bit of a bank a big bank roll yeah we
(04:55) won we can knock that one off we knock that one off and now we got $11 got be quick on these tables about on the right thing yeah first and last and what's our list look like one two three four five six seven eight nine so a bit closer 22 we keep missing right just lost $22 I need to bet 23 I guess this is a good way to test out how good the strategy is because
(06:00) because we have not got off to a good start this might take longer than an hour so about 46 Euros here I I don't want to be losing this one because otherwise things get a bit complicated okay we won that one let's knock it off our list we can go back to 11 lost my mouse almost forgot how to do it then have a look at those numbers um first first and middle dozen and we've bet 11 keep on saying dollars Euros got 11 Euros on each dozen okay couple of winners now good
(07:15) let's knock it off we got four plus one we got five and we just bet five on made and first doesn't because we're we're following the winner I quite like just following the winner near enough every strategy that I do now just follows the winner because it gives a fair test of the betting strategy if we sort of dictate what we're betting on based on what's coming out let me know if you like to follow the winner I think it's just a good way to play it oh get out of zero oh 32 still a loser oh we just lost 10
(08:00) which means we have 11 to bet on middle and top dozen we've got one two three four five six seven so despite actually losing a fair amount of spins considering the probabilities of winning we're almost well not almost but we're getting closer to completing that list and if you know labu share system if we complete our list we've got our profit which in our case going to be 10 33 is a winner knock off that one knock off that one so now we got five euros to bet and it's the middle and top doesn't
(08:53) again top doesn't middle doesn't and we have one two three four five numbers on ol in the video that I've just released I said it would take about 10 spins based on the pure probabilities win two lose one obviously we've been losing a little bit more so we're a bit behind in terms of time but but if we complete it we're okay so let's go there knock that one off knock this one off and now it's just a twoo bet that right so one + one is two but with this Matchmaker system apologies if I've stolen it from
(09:48) somebody I genuinely have never seen anybody do this before um two on each of the dozens and if we win this we just have one Euro on each 23 good knock it off so we just got one number left and we're going which means we got one Euro or dollar or pound or whatever you like to play on each dozen and then that is one set of € 10 complete we reset our list we go again with 10 minutes in so hopefully we do this that's a list completed and actually we are on time then and that was with quite a bad setup we're not there yet
(10:42) Greg we're not there yet so we just lost two Euros that means we've got three Euros to bet and we're going on the first and the middle a look at that first and middle list 1+ 2 is three and got three Euros on our cousin we missed can't take it off I just lost six which means you got seven euros to bet now 27 three there's our list 6+ 1 7even sevenos on
(11:50) both if we lose this 14 gets added to the list oh we have lost it as well we're so close at 14 so we got 15 euros to bet middle and L obviously if we lose this 30 gets added to the list so this is why I've not started at crazy numbers this is why I've started at just one Euro bets because if you start hitting a losing streak like we just had FL we should not have lost this many bets considering what we're betting on oh come on we just lost again okay that was a 30 loss so we need to put 31 get these on quickly and then I'll
(12:52) talk you through what we what we might do next if we lose that if we lose this this is going to to be a 62 Euro loss and I'm not putting 62 onto the end of my list I'm just going to break it up into 231s hopefully it doesn't come to that but I will show you how that works if we if we have to be a low number not happening so I'm adding 31 twice now I'm putting 30 that's on I've got a 32 Euro bet now go on to that list 31 plus 31 32 I've got 32 Euros on both um on both columns big bets the we
(13:55) were so close this is why that's the secret weapon that we can use okay we can knock that one off we can knock that one off but now I need to put 33 why do I need to put 33 31 plus two it should be a good system but it's quite it's quite difficult to sort of keep an eye on probably not one for people that aren't that comfortable at the roulette table hopefully we can just tick this one off and get back down to uh to reasonable numbers okay 33 we won that one take that off tick that off we need to put 36 now
(15:03) yeah it can if you start hitting some losers then your list can start getting a bit a bit too bigadi new dealer fingers crossed no way not adding it all so I'm going to put it twice again because these numbers are getting a bit too big we've got 42 eurs that we need to put on now 40 oh no too slow too slow um that might have messed up the entire thing I'm 15o short here if I if I hit the first dozen which I shouldn't even be bet on have a lck hopefully it's the middle
(16:12) middle column middle dozen all right we got very very lucky there now 50 look at these numbers they get they get huge when you start missing we we were doing we had a two yoro bet there but we hit loser loser loser which we should not be hitting loser loser loser that often when playing two dozens have a look at that Leist okay eight black and now we have 30 we got one number left we got
(17:25) 30 it's important to knock off a list as soon as possible because otherwise start having pretty crazy bets but you should technically complete a list pretty quick because you got a two out of three chance of winning right finally we did it that was a lot of hard work for 10 euros but let's start again so we'll miss this next Spin and we just get our new list together got one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 let this one spin you've been with me for 18 minutes and we've only just made 10 euros but let's see if the second
(18:19) attempt the second list is is easier I'm hoping it just go in 10 spins that's what it should be number [Music] right twoos on the end and the middle middle column top uh sorry middle dozen top dozen got our list again after somehow almost having a bit of a heart attack just winning 10 EUR but but I think that goes to prove that this system despite hitting so many losers we can still come out of a bit of a profit 21 red let's knock that off let's knock that off and essentially repeat the
(19:27) bat just to let you know if the balance sort of goes up or down a little bit strange um this is a crypto Casino we're we're playing at Wall Street meme casino and what's really great about this is I'm going to share some of the winnings with you guys so if we make 50 I'm going to share 25 let's let's try and win first and before we start sharing any money we won that one repeat the BET yes so Wall Street M Casino um obviously a crypto Casino the great thing about this is well the the tables are fantastic the
(20:11) welcome bonus is also really good they've just improved it so you can um you get a 200% deposit bonus but you also get some free spins and free bets depending on how much you deposit and then I can also if you join a Discord few seconds just let me update this list this is this is how it should be nice and easy win every spin um yeah if you join the Discord sign up to Wall Street meme casino with the link below well actually you go to a review page you can read about it sign up using uh the link and then I can send you winnings it's why
(20:51) I'm using Wall Street M Casino not just because they're a great Casino good bonuses good tables good games but because I can send you my winnings that's what it's all about if we win which I'm hopeful that we will because I put my name to this system hey we got a loser there I put four on the end the list we're on five now about first dozen first dozen last dozen expect to win every single um every single bet on a on a on a list can we we lose this we put 10 on our list but we didn't lose which is good we
(21:59) can knock that off we can knock that off and we're going back to twoos I didn't even realize I had a twoo chip I was messing around with clicking one Euro twice they've got two Euro chips didn't even didn't even pay attention there we go now and know which makes this uh which will make this system a bit faster because we're doing we're starting off with two Euro bets and obviously guys this is very scalable so I'm doing 10 five times you can do 20 five times you can you can make it your own but our goal 50 one
(22:46) hour okay we got that then now we just need one Euro on each dozen and we got to this point last time time and then ended up doing 35 per per dozen which was a bit scary what do you think about that secret strategy where we basically half the amount that we add onto our list I think it's a smart way to do [Music] it okay well that was a much easier list so essentially we tick it off we're 20 up let's keep going let's make this another 10o Target we we'll miss out this next bet one two three oh let me
(23:39) I'm on the wrong thing one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 we've got our list we're 20 up we do this three more times we I think we're on track for about an hour actually so this this is pretty cool number that's a good one to uh to skip out because we we would have missed that right two Euros on the first dozen and the middle dozen I would like the exact same outcome as that previous list you have to rewind the video and tell me how long that took it it felt 9 10 spins about what I'd expect um
(24:30) in terms of probabilities obviously we're covering we are covering 24 out of 37 numbers so I'd expect to win quite often okay we can knock that off knock that off and we can repeat our bet the Matchmaker um send this to there's obviously a lot of great YouTube channel sorry roulette YouTube channels you got roulette Master you got Jack a you even got the ceg dealer school I'd love to see them try this it's a bit complicated so they might not want to with the right in the list and all that sort of stuff
(25:18) but um it'd be good to it'd be good to see what grading they give it it's another win might be too low limits for those guys I know uh I'm not disrespecting them they do they do a lot of good work but I think I'm one of the very few that actually play with with real money um I've felt you've been you've told me in the comments that you that you appreciate me putting my money where my mouth is these videos can get expensive I think the first ever live example that I did I lost $500 so I almost didn't
(25:52) want to do anymore but I I think it just makes it more realistic if I'm going through the number and I'm saying oh this is good this is bad then I should be putting my money where my mouth it's really another one repeat that is this too much hard no it's not too much hard work for 50 an hour is it I don't know what could sure you live in but I'm in the UK and 50 an hour or 50 an hour there some good money obviously there's a bit of risk to it well there's more risk than than St a
(26:44) regular job we've lost that one we had four to the list and we're betting five euros now but be betting on top and bottom doen top and top and bottom dozen and our list looks pretty good nothing crazy obviously if we lose this we go to 10 onto the end that's a winner knock it off twoos on the same we win this then we're on to just a one
(27:52) bet the first the first list was it put us to the test is it so at least it wasn't all plane sailing I would obviously just love to just go 10 10 10 10 10 and walk away 50 oros that one was a winner so we got one Euro on the first and last first and last dozen we win this with 30 up and must confess I think we're going to be a bit more than 30 up because I didn't have time to bet on that first dozen so we got a bit lucky but at least it shows that the the concept works like we wouldn't have we would not have lost any
(28:46) more bank roll or anything like that because we went on a winning streak but I think my bank roll is going to be a little bit higher okay 30 up we can essentially delete that list and start again we we'll skip out this next spin whilst we update our list that seems to be good luck one two three four five 6 78 nine 10 I was counting that I didn't even have the right screen on yeah 10 there skip this one and let's jump on to the next one we got a one but never mind first and last dozen based on our numbers had three first dozens and then
(29:44) a last one and we're 30 up and we are half an hour in so we are we are on track for this to be a 50 an hour profit the last two have been very fast obviously the first one the first one was not fast and was a bit scary another first doesen knock off our list and repeat the B guys quick reminder not come to the Discord not just for the giveaway we've got some outrageously smart people in the Discord that have built spreadsheets that talking about strategies that know about the terms and conditions of bonuses um a lot of people that know a
(30:46) lot about roulette we'll be doing more videos and more topics about other casino games but if if roulette is your game I'd like to think of myself as a knowledgeable person obviously on the on the games but there's other people in there that are that are really good and will help you out and give you some tips and strategies knock that off and repeat our bat what's our balance at € 767 I will not be surprised if this balance starts jumping up and down because um at the at the time of recording this we're going into the
(31:34) Bitcoin harving obviously crypto markets can go a bit bizarre um during that time one I like itat that is's our list oh this is this one's a clean sweep so far I shouldn't jinx it but it'd be pretty cool if we can just five in a row and um tick it off and then and then we've just got one more list to do and we're 50 up Watch What Happens now I've said that okay I tell you what this first dozen come on then let's have a clean sweep let's have um just have five in a row and Euro
(32:40) profit added to our already 30 Euro profit and we've got one more to go and we've got half an hour we've got half an hour to make another 10 euros if this lands can't help but T's fake can I I I almost deserve to lose attempt and fate like I count my winnings before I've even won another first dozen right that was a clean sweep five spins List complete let's tick it off set this one out it seems to be good luck and we'll just get our final list this count along with you one 2 3 4 5 5
(33:28) 6 7 8 9 oh don't need one more three four five six 7even 8 nine 10 yeah we're looking good so set this one out he can not miss this first doesen look at these numbers first doesn't first doesen first doesn't first dozen last dozen first dozen first dozen first dozen first dozen last dozen if you're playing the middle if you like playing the middle column here sorry the middle dozen you're out you have got no money left that's why we play Follow The Winner because when things like this
(34:15) happen um we can capitalize on it okay it wasn't in the bot column but it was a winner bottom column I don't know why I keep saying that first dozen not bottom column does anybody else like I used to be a roulette dealer and I still say column when I mean dozen and I say dozen when I mean column apologies if that um irritates you I will try I will try and stop this doing it I just don't know why I keep on messing it up I think it's I only mess it up when I'm doing these lists because I've got so much going on
(35:04) I've got the camera I've got the live roulette it's a pretty fast table this as well okay we've lost one let's add four to our list we've got five next we got five on each dozen and we are middle and last you think it's going to make us work for this last 10 euros I don't want another list like the first one it was too stressful it's going to do it to us it's going to do it to us oh we just lost 10 at 11 now okay 11 on our
(36:09) middle and first dozen maybe that last list was uh was too easy and now we're going to have to pay for it okay we hit a winner knock that one off knock that one off I'm on five middle and first quick look at this list four and one five on both dozens threw me off having a loser we we hadn't had a loser in in so long and we at two in a row low number just not a high number let's let's tick this list off and go away with 50o 16
(37:15) red knock that off we knock that off and we go back to two Euros euros on middle and first doesn't we're almost there guys we've almost made our 50 can't help but tempt it I'm feeling pretty good let me know if you like this or did that first list just put you off completely and you were like that is too crazy why are you betting 35 on uh on each dozen as a win I'm going to watch this video back and I'd be really interested to see how many times we lost in that first list despite covering such a a big
(38:20) portion of the of the board like we should be winning two out of three numbers and we must have lost like three out of four was a bit tough at times okay that's a loser add four to the list got five euro bets we following the winner so we going top dozen middle dozen we need one we need if we get three wins in a row we are complete but there's obvious risk to this casino well not cuz you know this Matchmaker system hit a couple of losers in a row bets get bets get big fast High number please I know she likes
(39:19) to hit the the low dozen hit it knock it off back to twoo bets okay just need two more we win this we're just done one Euro bet and we are 50 what we at 40 minutes might quit work 50 an hour 27 red let's knock that off and we're just done a one bet each before I forget because if this lands then it's game over and we've completed our 50o um challenge I am giving away half of this
(40:26) I'm giving away 25 old so Discord turnout out to Wall Street M Casino let me know your deposit address and I'll put you in a raffle and we'll give it that away I gave 40 away to somebody in the Discord to to Kim so that was nice job done job done guys 50 has been made look at our balance 780 I must confess I can't remember what I started with but it was less than 730 like I said I think my balance is a little bit higher because of that small mistake that I made and also the crypto is going up and down a little bit so
(41:06) thanks very much for your time I'm really really glad that this Matchmaker system worked and we'll see you in the next video
